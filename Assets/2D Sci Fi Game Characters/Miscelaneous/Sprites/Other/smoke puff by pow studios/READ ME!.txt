This Smoke Puff Animation was made by pow studios. 

I do not own it . 

However according to pow studios I may use it for ANY PURPOSE as long as I give credit to pow studios which I did above and with the file name.

The following is an extraction from pow studios content download site:

I used the animation for the turret, when the drone unlinks from the rest to fly around.
